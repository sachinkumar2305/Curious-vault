## 🎯 Objective

Locate a Google Form link or key on https://webminx.wordpress.com/ to unlock the "Secret Vault" challenge.

---

## 🛠 Tools Used

- Browser developer tools (F12 &gt; Network tab)
- Web search
- X/Twitter search
- Logical deduction

---

## 🚶 Step-by-Step Breakdown

### 🔹 Step 1: Initial Exploration

- Visited https://webminx.wordpress.com/ and checked pages like Home, Blog (https://webminx.wordpress.com/blog-2/), and Contact (https://webminx.wordpress.com/contact/).
- Reviewed example posts (e.g., https://webminx.wordpress.com/2020/06/06/example-post-3/) for clues.

**Findings:** No Google Form links or obvious hints in HTML, JavaScript, or metadata.

---

### 🔹 Step 2: Network Analysis

- Used F12 &gt; Network tab, filtered for `google.com`, and reloaded pages.
- Submitted the contact form to check for hidden requests.

**Findings:** No `docs.google.com/forms` requests or keys (e.g., `formkey=77741479b79982f5bd0e2a1fc`) detected.

---

### 🔹 Step 3: External Search

- Conducted web searches for "MinX", "webminx.wordpress.com", "google form", and "secret vault".
- Searched X/Twitter for related terms.

**Findings:** No relevant links or clues found; site appears inactive with dummy content from 2020.

---

### 🔹 Step 4: Script Hint Investigation

- Explored the hint from an initial script mentioning a form key (`formkey=77741479b79982f5bd0e2a1fc`) and F12 &gt; Network tab.
- Tested a constructed URL (`https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLS.../viewform?formkey=77741479b79982f5bd0e2a1fc`).

**Findings:** URL invalid without a full form ID; no further leads.

---

### 🔹 Step 5: Final Attempts

- Rechecked all pages with Network tab, focusing on dynamic loads.
- Considered external sources (e.g., powershell.com) for additional hints.

**Response:** No link or key uncovered; challenge platform may expect "no link found" as a response.

---

## ❌ Where I Got Stuck

Despite logical steps:

- No Google Form link appeared in network requests or page content.
- Tried submitting the key `77741479b79982f5bd0e2a1fc` alone, but no validation.
- The site’s static nature suggests the form might be external or obscured.

> 🔍 Possibly the challenge requires a specific action (e.g., parameter) or external clue not yet identified.

---

## ✅ What This Shows (Skills Demonstrated)

- Web exploration and debugging with developer tools
- Network request analysis
- Logical deduction from limited clues
- Persistence in problem-solving

---

## 📚 Learnings

- Static sites can hide challenges in dynamic requests or external hints.
- Error messages or lack thereof can be part of the puzzle.
- Sometimes, the solution tests how you handle dead ends.
